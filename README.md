# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification
NSP Nexus Internship - Week 1 Project

## 🔍 Objective
To build a basic machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on sepal and petal measurements.

## 📦 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`

## 🛠️ Steps Performed
1. Loaded the Iris Dataset using sklearn
2. Explored the dataset using visualization
3. Preprocessed using `train_test_split()`
4. Trained a K-Nearest Neighbors model
5. Evaluated using `accuracy_score` and confusion matrix
6. Visualized the confusion matrix

## 📊 Result
Achieved over **97% accuracy** on test data using the KNN model.

## 🚀 How to Run
- Open `iris_classification.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter
- Run each cell in sequence
- See outputs and plots inline
